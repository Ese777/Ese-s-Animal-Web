  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Have you been to the zoo? You must have seen all sorts of animals. But have you ever asked yourself if you are an animal yourself? Well, I'm typing to answer that question by telling you the different types of animals.</p>
   <h2>1. Mammals</h2>
   <p> Mammals have hair or fur; are warm-blooded; most are born alive; the young are fed milk produced by the mother's mammary glands; and they have a more complex brain than other animals. This video will elaborate on it.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGonwMTPV6g">All about Mammals</a> Creatures such as humans, dogs, elephant and much more are classified as mammals.</p><img src="images/dog.jpg" alt="Dog">
   <h2>2. Reptiles</h2>
   <p>Reptiles are vertebrates. They have backbones. Their bodies are completely covered with scales. They are cold-blooded. Reptiles produce shelled eggs or bear live young. All species fertilize eggs internally. All species of reptiles have at least one lung.
